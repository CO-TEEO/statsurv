Update our data sources and documentation
Delete extract_alarm_statistic (wanted to copy documentation over first)
Delete extract_clusters (wanted to copy documentation over first)
Delete test-extract_yhat-inla.R (wanted to adapt some of the tests for tidy_inla and glance_inla)
Move generate_study_area to the gridcoord package

Where possible, replace internal arg checks and errors with rlangs and stopifnot - we get a less nice error message, in exchange for less/cleaner code

Tests for parallel_cusum_gaussian
Tests for parallel2

Remove the "report_model_coeff" wrapper - we'll just use broom for the most part
Promote tidy_inla and glance_inla into proper functions we can use independently
Documentation and examples for report_top_clusters
Documentation and examples for scan_statistics2
Update overall documentation for the package
Document presidents_df dataset

Add a `min_k` argument to space_coord to zones
Add a `step` argument to window_idtime

Write a reasonable vignette or two

Clean up our tests

Remove dependence on gridcoord
Remove dependence on sp
Figure out what we're doing with scanstatistics
Figure out what to do about the conflicting names when we unnest at the very end
