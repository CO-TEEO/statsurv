    person(given = "Paul",
           family = "Romer Present",

Description: A set of tools for performing routine statistical surveillance.
    staturv makes it easy to repeatedly apply the key tools of statistical surveillance,
    while remaining flexible enough to be incorporated into almost any workflow.
    Spatsurv can support several different model types for predicting the number of incidents, 
    including lm, glm, INLA, and ARIMA models, and can detect anomalies using scan statistics,
    CUSUM charts, or Shewhart charts.
